# EventHorizon
EventHorizon is an interactive game mode extension developed for the KSU Esports Minecraft server, aimed at boosting replayability and player engagement. It introduces random, server-wide events—categorized as positive, neutral, or negative—that challenge players to adapt and survive in both solo and team-based gameplay. These unpredictable occurrences create a dynamic and thrilling environment. EventHorizon can run as a standalone mode or integrate seamlessly with speedrun and competitive events for a fresh, ever-evolving experience.

## Installation & Setup:
The EventHorizon plugin is compatible with Minecraft version 1.21.4 and the corresponding PaperMC server.  

*EventHorizon assumes that **ALL** worlds are participating in EventHorizon, meaning that all gamerules, entities, etc. are potentially being modified on every loaded world.*  

For guidance on setting up a Paper server, refer to the official documentation:\
